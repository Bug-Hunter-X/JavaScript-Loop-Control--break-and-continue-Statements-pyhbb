# JavaScript Loop Control: break and continue Statements

This repository demonstrates a common error related to the use of `break` and `continue` statements within loops in JavaScript. The `break` statement will exit the loop prematurely, and the `continue` statement will skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next one.

## Bug.js
This file contains code that shows how `break` can unexpectedly terminate a loop.

## BugSolution.js
This file shows the same loop, but without the premature termination. The solution demonstrates careful consideration of the intended loop behavior.

Understanding how `break` and `continue` alter loop flow is essential for writing correct and predictable JavaScript code.
